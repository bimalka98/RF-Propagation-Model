\section{Modeling the RF propagation Model Using Matlab}
%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Relationship between Free Space Path Loss and Frequency}

\textit{Consider  following meanings for the parameters}\\

\begin{tabular}{l l }
	$P_{RX}$ & = Received Power at the Receiving Antenna\\
	$P_{TX}$ & = Transmitted Power at the Transmitting Antenna\\
	$f$ & = Frequency of the wave in Hz\\
	$f_{GHz}$ & = Frequency of the wave in GHz\\
	$d$& = Distance between the antennas in m\\
	$d_{km}$& = Distance between the antennas in km\\
	$G_{TX}$& = Directive gain of the Transmitter\\
	$G_{RX}$& = Directive gain of the Receiver\\
	$c$& = Velocity of the electromagnetic waves in a vacuum\\

\end{tabular}\\[1cm]


The relationship between above parameters can be given as follows
\[
\begin{split}
P_{RX} & = P_{TX}.\frac{c^2}{(4\pi.f.d)^2}.G_{TX}.G_{RX}
\end{split}
\]
From the above equation, free space path loss, say $L$
\[
\begin{split}
L = \frac{(4\pi.f.d)^2}{c^2}
\end{split}
\]

By considering $\ 10.log_{10}()$ in both sides, Free Space Path Loss in dB, say $L_{dB}$

\[
\begin{split}
10.\log_{10}(L) &= 10.\log_{10}(\frac{(4\pi.f.d)^2}{c^2})\\
L_{dB}& = 10.\log_{10}((4\pi.f.d)^2) - 10.\log_{10}(c^2)\\
&=20.\log_{10}(4\pi.f.d)-20.\log_{10}(c)\\
&=20.\log_{10}(4\pi)-20.\log_{10}(c) + 20.\log_{10}(f) + 20.\log_{10}(d)\\
&=20.\log_{10}(\frac{4\pi}{c}) + 20.\log_{10}(f) + 20.\log_{10}(d)\\
&= -147.5522168 + 20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz}.10^9) + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km}.10^3)\\
& = -147.5522168 + 20.\log_{10}(10^9)+ 20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz}) + 20.\log_{10}(10^3) + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
&= -147.5522168 + 180+ 20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz}) + 60 + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
&= -147.5522168 + 240+ 20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz}) + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
&= +92.44778322+20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz}) + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})
\end{split}
\]
Since transmitter and receiver are located at distance of 10km apart, by substituting $d_{km}= 10$.\\

Free Space Path Loss in dB, $L_{dB}$ as a function of frequency in Giga Hertz

\[
\begin{split}
L_{dB}(f_{GHz})&=  +112.44778322+20.\log_{10}(f_{GHz})
\end{split}
\]

\textbf{\textit{Note : Axes of the following plots are given in the logarithmic scale and range of frequency was chosen from 50 GHz to 1000 GHz since some of the ITU-R models are only defined in the 10 GHz-1000 GHz range.}}

\subsection{Rain attenuation, Fog attenuation and Atmospheric gas attenuation with Frequency}

\textit{Note : For the generation of following plots three of the Matlab built-in functions, namely \textbf{rainpl()\cite{matlab}, gaspl()\cite{matlab}, fogpl()\cite{matlab}} which are developed according to the ITU-R P Series recommendations were used and links for their documentations are given at the Reference section.}


\subsubsection{Rain attenuation - Recommendation ITU-R P.838-3, 2005\cite{rain}}
The following plot shows how losses due to rain varies with frequency. The plot assumes the followings in addition to the provided information in the Task 1.\\

\begin{tabular}{l l}
Elevation angle of the propagation path& = 0 \\
Polarization tilt angle of the signal &= 0\\
\end{tabular}\\

In general, horizontal polarization represents the worse case for propagation loss due to rain.

\subsubsection{Fog attenuation - Recommendation ITU-R P.840-3, 2013\cite{fog}}
The following plot shows how losses due to fog/cloud varies with frequency. The plot assumes the following provided information in the Task 1.\\

\begin{tabular}{l l}
	Ambient Temperature in Celsius&= 31\\
	Liquid Water Density in $g/m^3$&= 0.5\\

\subsubsection{Atmospheric gas attenuation - Recommendation ITU-R P.676-10, 2013\cite{gas}}

The plot below shows how the propagation loss due to atmospheric gases varies with the frequency. The plot assumes the followings in addition to the provided information in the Task 1.

\begin{tabular}{l l}
	 Dry air pressure in Pa&= 101325\\
	 Water Vapor Density in $g/m^3$&= 30.4\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Total Path Loss with Frequency}
\textit{Note : Range of frequency was chosen from 50 GHz to 1000 GHz since some of the ITU-R models are only defined in 10 GHz - 1000 GHz range.}
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{figures/TotalPL.png}
	\caption{Relationship between Total Path Loss and Frequency}
\end{figure}

By inspecting the figure we can conclude that the minimum propagation loss is given at the frequency of 50 GHz in the given range. Therefore from this point onward, for the calculations it will be the frequency for transmission.

%\subsection{Link Budget Calculation}
%
%Parameters For the propagation model
%\begin{tabular}{l r}
%Chosen transmission frequency & 10 GHz\\
%Total Path Loss & 136.9 dB\\
%Transmission power & 50 kW or 47 dB\\
%Transmitter Gain & 30 dB\\
%Receiver Gain &24.77 dB\\
%Link margin  &11 dB\\
%Cable loss at Transmitter & 3 dB\\
%Cable loss at Receiver &4 dB\\
%\end{tabular}\\[1cm]
%
%Let's find the actual received power at the receiver\\
%
%\begin{tabular}{|l l| r|}
%	\hline
%Received Power =	&Transmission power & +47 dB\\
%&	Cable loss at Transmitter & -3 dB\\
%&	Transmitter Gain & 30 dB\\

\subsection{Variation of the Signal Power with the Distance}

Parameters For the propagation model\\

\begin{tabular}{l r}
Chosen transmission frequency & 50 GHz\\
Transmission power & 50 kW or 47 dB\\
Cable loss at Transmitter & 3 dB\\
Transmitter Gain & 30 dB\\
Receiver Gain &24.77 dB\\
Cable loss at Receiver &4 dB\\
Total Path Loss & Varies with Distance\\
\end{tabular}\\[1cm]

According to above values, Let's calculate the Power of the signal when leaving the  Transmission antenna, say $P_{dB}(0~km)$,

\[
\begin{split}
P_{dB}(0~km) & = Transmission~power -  Cable~loss~at~Transmitter + Transmitter~Gain\\
&=47-3+30\\
&=74~dB
\end{split}
\]

Free Space Path Loss in dB, $L_{dB}$ as a function of distance in kilo meters. By substituting $f_{GHz}$ = 50 to the equation derived in part 1.

\[
\begin{split}
L_{dB}(d_{km})&= +92.44778322+20.\log_{10}(50) + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
&=+92.44778322+ 33.97940009 + 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
&=+126.4271833+ 20.\log_{10}(d_{km})\\
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, \[Total~Path~Loss = L_{dB}(d_{km}) + Rain~Attenuation+Fog~Attenuation+Atmospheric~Gas~Attenuation \]

Therefore the Signal Power when reaching the Receiving Antenna at $d_{km}$ distance,
\[
\begin{split}
P_{dB}(d_{km}) & =74~dB - Total~Path~Loss
\end{split}
\]

\section{Implementing a Simplified Version of the Dynamic Source Routing(DSR) Protocol in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks}
%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Assumptions used in the implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transmission ranges of all the nodes is the same and hence bidirectional communication is possible between two neighboring nodes
	\item Therefore, the source route of the RREP(Route Reply) is replaced with source route of RREQ(Route Request) packet.
	\item Route maintenance found in original DSR protocol is skipped for simplicity.
\end{itemize}
